# our drive uses z to map the removable disk
# to delete any preused drives

net use z: /delete

Let's say our drive's name we use is e,

# make the usb a shared file
net use z: \\\\192.168.55.52\\e

# first create a mount folder - named 'mount'
# you need to have a sudo access
# if our server information is username@server_address:port

Now we can move to the server's terminal, and execute the rest of the commands

if there is no mount folder, we should create a mount point
sudo mkdir /home/username/mount

then to mount our usb drive into our server, we can execute this command, where 192.168.55.52 is the ip address of the company
sudo mount.cifs //192.168.55.52/e /home/username/mount -o user=share,password=share

# if that returns a 'resource busy' error, first unmount it using this command -> sudo umount -l /home/username/mount


Now all you need to do is execute the detect.py from the yolov5 repository we have forked (named as ML_model)
# change your directory to GUI-AI-project/, and change video_name 

python3 ML_model/detect.py --weights ML_model/checkpoints/railway.pt --source /home/username/mount/video_name.mp4 --project /home/username/mount/
